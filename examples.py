    Task: This question refers to the following information. In Russia there was nothing going on well, and [Souvarine] was in despair over the news he had 
        received. His old companions were all turning to the politicians; the famous Nihilists who made Europe tremble-sons of village priests, of the lower 
        middle class, of tradesmen-could not rise above the idea of national liberation, and seemed to believe that the world would be delivered-when they had 
        killed their despot&… "Foolery! They'll never get out of it with their foolery." Then, lowering his voice still more, in a few bitter words he described 
        his old dream of fraternity. He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of 
        a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with 
        the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering. But decidedly the fusion 
        had not taken place. His voice changed, his eyes grew bright, he fixed them on étienne, directly addressing him: "Now, do you understand that? These 
        hatworkers at Marseilles who have won the great lottery prize of a hundred thousand francs have gone off at once and invested it, declaring that they 
        are going to live without doing anything! Yes, that is your idea, all of you French workmen; you want to unearth a treasure in order to devour it alone 
        afterwards in some lazy, selfish corner. You may cry out as much as you like against the rich, you haven't got courage enough to give back to the poor 
        the money that luck brings you. You will never be worthy of happiness as long as you own anything, and your hatred of the bourgeois proceeds solely 
        from an angry desire to be bourgeois yourselves in their place." émile Zola, French writer, Germinal, 1885 The passage displays the direct concern 
        for the welfare of the working classes that was typically a part of which movement? [ "Communist", "Anarchist", "Feminist", "Fascist", "Imperialist", "Nationalist", "Enlightenment", "Existentialist", "N/A", "N/A" ]

        Birth control movement in the United States
        Birth control practices were generally adopted earlier in Europe than in the United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, with the goal of challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League -- the world's first birth control advocacy group -- which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.
